abstract = {We report the quantitative and simultaneous detection of four species of bacteria, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella choleraesuis serotype typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter jejuni, using an eight-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor based on wavelength division multiplexing. Detection curves showing SPR response versus analyte concentration were established for each species of bacteria in buffer at pH 7.4, apple juice at native pH 3.7, and apple juice at an adjusted pH of 7.4, as well as for a mixture containing all four species of bacteria in buffer. Control experiments were performed to show the non-fouling characteristics of the sensor surface as well as the specificity of the amplification antibodies used in this study. The limit of detection (LOD) for each of the four species of bacteria in the tested matrices ranges from 3.4×103 to 1.2×105cfu/ml. Detection curves in buffer of an individual species of bacteria in a mixture of all four species of bacteria correlated well with detection curves of the individual species of bacteria alone. SPR responses were higher for bacteria in apple juice at pH 7.4 than in apple juice at pH 3.7. This difference in sensor response could be partly attributed to the pH dependence of antibody–antigen binding.}
