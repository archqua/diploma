ABSTRACT = {Microfluidics is a relatively newly emerged field based on the combined principles of physics, chemistry, biology, fluid dynamics, microelectronics, and material science. Various materials can be processed into miniaturized chips containing channels and chambers in the microscale range. A diverse repertoire of methods can be chosen to manufacture such platforms of desired size, shape, and geometry. Whether they are used alone or in combination with other devices, microfluidic chips can be employed in nanoparticle preparation, drug encapsulation, delivery, and targeting, cell analysis, diagnosis, and cell culture. This paper presents microfluidic technology in terms of the available platform materials and fabrication techniques, also focusing on the biomedical applications of these remarkable devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics is promising for early detection of a number of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, in addition to serving for monitoring health conditions. To be efficient and cost-effective, portable PoC devices are made with microfluidic technologies, with which laboratory analysis can be made with small-volume samples. Recent years have witnessed considerable progress in this area with &ldquo;epidermal electronics&rdquo;, including miniaturized wearable diagnosis devices. These wearable devices allow for continuous real-time transmission of biological data to the Internet for further processing and transformation into clinical knowledge. Other approaches include bluetooth and WiFi technology for data transmission from portable (non-wearable) diagnosis devices to cellphones or computers, and then to the Internet for communication with centralized healthcare structures. There are, however, considerable challenges to be faced before PoC devices become routine in the clinical practice. For instance, the implementation of this technology requires integration of detection components with other fluid regulatory elements at the microscale, where fluid-flow properties become increasingly controlled by viscous forces rather than inertial forces. Another challenge is to develop new materials for environmentally friendly, cheap, and portable microfluidic devices. In this review paper, we first revisit the progress made in the last few years and discuss trends and strategies for the fabrication of microfluidic devices. Then, we discuss the challenges in lab-on-a-chip biosensing devices, including colorimetric sensors coupled to smartphones, plasmonic sensors, and electronic tongues. The latter ones use statistical and big data analysis for proper classification. The increasing use of big data and artificial intelligence methods is then commented upon in the context of wearable and handled biosensing platforms for the Internet of things and futuristic healthcare systems.},

	abstract = {The Freundlich adsorption isotherm is mostly presented as an empirical equation and the (fractal) Langmuir adsorption isotherm is derived from kinetics. However, their constants are determined by thermodynamic approach. As yet, both are used as an independent tool for determining the type of adsorption, just physical or chemical adsorption. This study aims to introduce an alternative way of driving Freundlich adsorption isotherm from kinetics, to elaborate its relation with the (fractal) Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and to determine their constants simultaneously by kinetics approach. An alternative way of determining the constants in both isotherm equations by kinetics approach was introduced. The results were then compared with that obtained by the conventional method. The study is theoretical but the validity of determination technique is based on the statistical tests on data adapted from literature. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm is introduced; the isotherm is the (fractal) Langmuir adsorption isotherm at relatively low concentration. It is irrelevant to use both adsorption isotherm separately. The new method is more reliable and its represent the reaction.}

abstract = {Surface-based binding assays are often influenced by the transport of analyte to the sensor surface. Using simulated data sets, we test a simple two-compartment model to see if its description of transport and binding is sufficient to accurately analyze BIACORE data. First we present a computer model that can generate realistic BIACORE data. This model calculates the laminar flow of analyte within the flow cell, its diffusion both perpendicular and parallel to the sensor surface, and the reversible chemical reaction between analyte and immobilized reactant. We use this computer model to generate binding data under a variety of conditions. An analysis of these data sets with the two-compartment model demonstrates that good estimates of the intrinsic reaction rate constants are recovered even when mass transport influences the binding reaction. We also discuss the conditions under which the two-compartment model can be used to determine the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. Our results illustrate that this model can significantly extend the range of association rate constants that can be accurately determined from BIACORE.}

Single-cycle kinetic was used to determine the number of binding epitopes on polystyrene nanoparticle with transferrin corona. The number of available epitopes describes how active the Nanoparticle will be in the body. For this purpose Single-cycle kinetic methodology was successfully used on nanoparticles. Single-cycle kinetic methodology has great potential to become the standard method for high throughput nanoparticle epitope characterization. },

	Abstract = {Precise and effective control of droplet generation is critical for applications of droplet microfluidics ranging from materials synthesis to lab-on-a-chip systems. Methods for droplet generation can be either passive or active, where the former generates droplets without external actuation, and the latter makes use of additional energy input in promoting interfacial instabilities for droplet generation. A unified physical understanding of both passive and active droplet generation is beneficial for effectively developing new techniques meeting various demands arising from applications. Our review of passive approaches focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of breakup modes of droplet generation occurring in microfluidic cross-flow, co-flow, flow-focusing, and step emulsification configurations. The review of active approaches covers the state-of-the-art techniques employing either external forces from electrical, magnetic and centrifugal fields or methods of modifying intrinsic properties of flows or fluids such as velocity, viscosity, interfacial tension, channel wettability, and fluid density, with a focus on their implementations and actuation mechanisms. Also included in this review is the contrast among different approaches of either passive or active nature.},
